    <div>The Problem: The interface here is trying to solve the problem of making 
      the printing process easier and quicker for students. Here one can add to the 
      printing queue from their local computer or from the ‘Computers to Access area 
      and once they go ahead and swipe their card it will appear on the Printing Display 
      and they may proceed with the printing process. This allows for the payment, 
      person, and printout to all be done through a single swipe of the card.
